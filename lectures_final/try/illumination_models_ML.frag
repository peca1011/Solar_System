/*
14_illumination_models_ML_TX.frag: as 12_illumination_models_ML.frag, but with texturing

N.B. 1)  "13_illumination_models_ML_TX.vert" must be used as vertex shader

N.B. 2) In this example, we consider point lights only. For different kind of lights, the computation must be changed (for example, a directional light is defined by the direction of incident light, so the lightDir is passed as uniform and not calculated in the shader like in this case with a point light).

N.B. 3)  the different illumination models are implemented using Shaders Subroutines

N.B. 4)  only Blinn-Phong and GGX illumination models are considered in this shader

N.B. 5) see note 2 in the vertex shader for considerations on multiple lights management
